An experimental comparative study on slide change detection in lecture videos
In today’s world e-learning is one of the popular modes of learning and video lectures are more prominent in keeping learners engaged with course.  Internet enabled to keep a large number of video lectures on-line. To search for a required topic or subtopic from this huge video repository is becoming very tedious.  One way to search for a particular topic is through keyword based search and it is based on extraction of text content available in lecture video files and to achieve it one has to maintain metadata. To maintain the metadata associated with video the frames of video containing text are required to be processed. As the video contains multiple frames per second it is not required to consider each and every frame. So, the frames containing distinct content called key frames need to be identified. The identification of key frames plays crucial role in the lecture video searching process. In this work, different techniques for key frame identification are experimentally tested and results were compared.

The experimental results show that:
•	The Dark Pixel Distribution Difference can identify most of the slide changes accurately for all the time intervals considered between frames of video belonging to Type-1 Videos, however, for Type-2 Videos number of false slide transitions detected are high compared to other methods.
•	When both Type-1 and Type-2 videos were considered in evaluating Slide Changes Detection performance, the Global Pixel Difference and Connected Component based methods were good in both Recall and Precision values.
•	It is observed that the time interval between frames selected for transition detection influences the Slide Change Detection performance.
•	The time interval between frames can be selected as 3 or 4 seconds because the missed slides of duration 1 or 2 seconds can be neglected. 
•	By choosing the interval as 3 or 4 seconds the complexity can be reduced as the number of frames used for the Slide Change Detection is greatly reduced. But, with the time interval as 3 or 4 seconds the exact slide transition time may not be detected.
