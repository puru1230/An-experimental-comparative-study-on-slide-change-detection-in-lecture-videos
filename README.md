An experimental comparative study on slide change detection in lecture videos
In todayâ€™s world e-learning is one of the popular modes of learning and video lectures are more prominent in keeping learners engaged with course.  Internet enabled to keep a large number of video lectures on-line. To search for a required topic or subtopic from this huge video repository is becoming very tedious.  One way to search for a particular topic is through keyword based search and it is based on extraction of text content available in lecture video files and to achieve it one has to maintain metadata. To maintain the metadata associated with video the frames of video containing text are required to be processed. As the video contains multiple frames per second it is not required to consider each and every frame. So, the frames containing distinct content called key frames need to be identified. The identification of key frames plays crucial role in the lecture video searching process. In this work, different techniques for key frame identification are experimentally tested and results were compared.
